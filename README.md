# Using Grpc In Microservices Communication With .Net5

With **gRPC** in ASP.NET 5, we will develop high-performance, cross-platform applications for building distributed systems and APIs. Itâ€™s an ideal choice for communication between backend microservices, internal network applications, or iot devices and services. With the release of ASP.NET 5, Microsoft has added first-class support for creating gRPC services with Asp.Net 5.

In this project, we will build, develop and manage gRPC servers and clients on distributed microservices architecture.
